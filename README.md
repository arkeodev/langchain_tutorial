# LangChain Tutorial

Welcome to the LangChain Tutorial repository. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and related files that demonstrate various functionalities of the LangChain framework.

## Repository Structure

- `langchain-chat-and-query-pdfs.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook showcasing how to use LangChain for chatting and querying PDF documents.
- `langchain-output-parsers.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of output parsers in LangChain.
- `langchain-react.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook illustrating the integration of LangChain with React.
- `langgraph-email-categorisation.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for categorizing emails using LangGraph and LangChain.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have Jupyter installed. If you don't have it yet, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Clone this repository:
